It is possible to add comments and messages to the chart.

####  GENERATE CHART MESSAGE WITH GPT3 

For some charts - currently simple and stacked column charts - it is possible to add a chart comment generated automatically using  GPT.

To enable automatic comments set the Generate chart message with GPTðŸ¤– widget to True. Please note that the summary data of  the chart will be shared with GPT.

The plotted chart will contain an AI-generated message.

You can move the message, the underlying line, and the chart title around with the mouse. You can edit the message to correct it. To split the message in more rows insert a "< BR >" tag (with no spaces). When you save your chart to png, the message will be included in the image file. 

#### GENERATE CHART MESSAGE MANUALLY

If you want to write your own chart comment (or if GPT comment is still not enabled for your chart) write your comment in the "Add message to plot" widget and hit the Plot Charts button. It is not possible to add messages to Venn and Upset charts. 

Your message will appear on top of your chart. You can edit and move the message.

 When you save your chart to png, the message will be included in the image file.
