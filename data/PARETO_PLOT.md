A Pareto chart is a type of chart that contains both bars and a line graph, where individual values are represented in descending order by bars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line. The chart is named for the Pareto principle, and its purpose is to highlight the most important among a set of factors.

The plot is run twice, once for each period. The bars and the cumulative % line are color-coded by their A,B,C class (A=up to 80%, B= 80 to 95%, C=95 to 100%, Loss = negative values).

You can force the plots to have the same scale setting the Fix scales ‚öñÔ∏è widget to true.

Open the expander under the üìä Plot type drop down menu by clicking on the ‚ûï sign.

You can choose the dimension you want to plot Y axes, and which metrics to plot. 

#### PLOT MULTIPLE METRICS

If you choose to plot more than one metric,  all plots will be ranked on the first chosen metric, "amount" in this example.

You can select as many metrics as you like. 

#### PLOT ABSOLUTE VALUES

You can choose to see the absolute values rather than the percentages. 

#### PLOT RANKINGS

You can plot rankings as labels.

#### FILTER TOP OR BOTTOM ITEMS

You can filter the plot to see only the top 30 items. 

You can also filter the plot to see the bottom 30 items.

#### NEGATIVE VALUES

Negative margin values are plotted in red. For instance, you can plot a chart showing the positive margin contribution of the "good" items, and how this is partially or totally eaten up by the negative margin of the "bad" items.
