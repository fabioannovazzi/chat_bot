The Filter🗑️Data panel allows you to:

- Filter your dataset.  The filtering criteria will appear in the first row of the chart title.
- Download your filtered dataset that you can upload on the app, so you do not have to re-apply the filter in the future. 

To filter choose a column. You can then select the items to include or exclude. 

If you filter a numeric column the filtering widgets will show as range widget filters.

The filtering criteria will appear in the first row of the plot title.

You can filter on up to four dimension columns. A new filter widget will appear underneath the filter you have set up. 

Set up the new filter and submit to plot the chart.

Both filters will appear in the first row of the plot title.
