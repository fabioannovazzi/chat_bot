#### IBCS three-line title concept

For every chart type, the chart title is set on three lines: the first line contains the reporting unit ("who"), the second line the business metric ("what") and the third line the time period ("when"). 

You can set reporting unit and currency in the LoadðŸ“¤Dataset tab.

The period is shown with the IBCS standard: underscore indicates YTD, tilde indicates 12 months running period.

If a filter is applied it will appear on the first row of the title instead of the reporting unit name.  

#### Adjusting the title position

You can adjust the position of the title, the message text and the horizontal line by moving them around with the mouse.
