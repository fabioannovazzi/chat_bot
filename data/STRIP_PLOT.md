A strip plot is a graphical data analysis technique for summarizing a univariate data set. 

The strip plot consists of an horizontal axis (the value of the response variable) and a vertical axis with all values set to 1. That is, a strip plot is simply a plot of the sorted response values along one axis. It is typically used for small data sets (histograms and density plots are typically preferred for larger data sets). A small random jitter value is applied to each data point such that the separation between points becomes clearer.

In accordance to the [IBCS](https://www.ibcs.com/) standard notation the most recent, measured, Actual data is plotted dark grew while the past (example previous year) data is plotted light grey. Plan data is also plotted light gray (instead of white boxed) due to technical limitations.

It is possible to show the chart in log scale.
