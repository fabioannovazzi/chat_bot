A Venn diagram is a widely-used diagram style that shows the logical relation between sets of items. A Venn diagram uses overlapping circles or other shapes to illustrate this relationship.

The plot is run twice, once for each period.

To plot the items as small multiples, set the Plot Small multiples widget to True, choose the dimension to plot as small multiples.

Choose the dimension you want to plot as circles of the plot as well as the dimension over which to calculate communality. 

You can choose to plot a Venn diagram with two or three circles.

If you choose to choose to plot two circles, by default the app will plot a third circle with "everything else".   

If you decide to plot three circles, the communality will be calculated among the three most important items by revenue, and all other items will be ignored.
