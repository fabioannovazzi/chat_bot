It is possible to annotate all charts except the Upset and Venn chart with lines, rectangles and circles. It is possible to modify the shapes and move them around. Deleting shapes does not work consistently. 

To add an annotation, hover and click on the "draw line", "draw circle" and "draw rectangle" icons on the menu bar on the upper right of the chart. Draw and edit your shape.
