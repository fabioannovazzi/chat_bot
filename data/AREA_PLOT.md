The area chart shows the evolution of the available metrics over time. It requires a Date column in the dataset.

The plot is run for the chosen dimension. For each dimension the value labels are shown for the first, last, highest and lowest values.

The integrated legends can also be positioned on the right or on the left of the plot...

Resampling data means aggregating time series by a new time period (bi-monthly instead of monthly for example) and smoothing out the plot

#### NORMALIZED PLOT

Values can be plotted in absolute value, as a % of total dataset, as a % of total dataset after filters, or as a % of the result row. The last two options only make sense if you plot a result row.
