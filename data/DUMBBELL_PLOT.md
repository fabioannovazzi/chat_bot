The Actual, value is show with a black dot. The other value, is shown with a grey (if Previous year) or white (if Plan) dot. Red bands are "bad" while green bands are "good." Dots are accompanied by value labels. 

Values can be plotted in absolute value, as a % of total dataset, as a % of total dataset after filters, or as a % of the result row. The last two options only make sense if you plot a result row.
