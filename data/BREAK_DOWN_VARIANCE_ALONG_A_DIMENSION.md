*Fix dimension bridge analysis* is the type of bridge analysis you are accustomed to and you have seen hundreds of times. 

The dimensions are the same in every row. These dimensions can be simply variance types as in this waterfall or can be associated with variance type and with one or more columns.

The fix-dimension bridge analysis waterfalls should cover the full amount of the variance value, with no residuals.  In this case the residual is tied to the fact that we limited the number of results. If we change the setting to 9 results and nine results is enough to cover all the values in the dimension, the balance goes to zero
