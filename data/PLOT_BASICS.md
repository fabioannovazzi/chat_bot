To plot a chart, you need to: 

(i) load a dataset, 

(ii) choose a plot, 

(iii) set the chart's parameters, 

(iv) hit the ðŸš€ Submit button.

You can select your plot with the ðŸ“Š Plot type widget. The  ðŸ“Š Plot type menu will show the plots that can be run with your dataset. For instance, the "Timeline" plot option will only be shown if the dataset has a Date column.

The âž• Plot ðŸ“Š options widget allows you to change the parameters of the plot you have chosen. 

You can record the parameters of your plots, download a JSON file with all said parameters, reload the JSON file, and replay your plots. You can also load a JSON file generated by GPT. You can modify and save the JSON file. 

One you load the JSON file, the app will automatically set the plot type and the plot parameters, so you just need to hit the Submit button and the Next Chart button to go to the next chart. 

The look and feel of our charts is due to [IBCS](https://www.ibcs.com/) , a set of best practices for consistent business communication that defines rules on how to structure reports, presentations and dashboards. ![IBCS](assets/images/IBCS-16842408781553.png)

The IBCS standard advocates for the use of a consistent color code in which red is "bad" and green is "good".  Actual, measured, data is displayed in charts as a solid dark grey fill. Measured data of previous periods is displayed as a solid light grey fill.  Plan, expected, data is display as white outlined.

For instance, this chart compares the previous year to the current year...

...while this chart compares Plan to Actual.
