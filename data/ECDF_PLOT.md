The Empirical Cumulative Distribution chart  is a representation of the distribution of numerical data (for example prices), that, for each point, shows the fraction of observations of the measured variable that are less than or equal to the specified value.

In accordance to the [IBCS](https://www.ibcs.com/) standard notation the most recent, measured, Actual data is plotted dark grew while the past (example previous year) data is plotted light grey. Plan data is also plotted light gray (instead of white boxed) due to technical limitations.

By clicking on a legend value you can filter that value on the chart.

By default, the distribution is analyzed by observation. It is possible to aggregate by some other dimension.

It is possible to show the chart in log scale.

You can plot the chart as reversed so that the right-most point is at 1 (or the total count/sum, depending on `ecdfnorm`) and the left-most point is above 0 . It will show the % of prices above a certain value.
