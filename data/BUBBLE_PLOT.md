Open the expander under the ðŸ“Š Plot type drop down menu by clicking on the âž• sign. 

You can choose which metric to assign to the x and y axes, and which to map as bubble size, as well as other options. 

Values can be plotted in absolute value, as a % of total dataset, as a % of total dataset after filters, or as a % of the result row. The last two options only make sense if you plot a result row.
