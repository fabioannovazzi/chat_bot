The plot will show the monthly difference between Actual and Plan or Actual vs Previous Year with a "red equals bad" and "green equals good" color scheme both at the total level and for each dimension

If the date of most recent information is not equal to December, the chart will plot the months reordered showing the most recent 12 months. 

#### BASELINE PLOT

You can set the plot to only show the difference of the actual data versus the other period/scenario or to show the difference between actual data and actual year average.
