The year-over-year column chart, inspired by this [IBCS template](https://www.ibcs.com/resource/horizontal-waterfall-chart/),  contains three parts. 

The lower tier of this chart shows grouped columns for AC and PY combined with a horizontal waterfall chart showing the absolute variances. An additional tiers show the relative variances to PY.
