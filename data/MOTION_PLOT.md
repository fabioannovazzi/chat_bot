The motion chart shows three metrics  in a Gapminder-like graph. It requires a Date column in the dataset.

By selecting a period in the select period cursor the chart will change and show the values at that point in time. 

The bubbles can be shown with or without labels.

It is possible to filter a specific class of bubbles.

Open the expander under the ðŸ“Š Plot type drop down menu by clicking on the âž• sign.

You can choose which metric to assign to the x and y axes, and which to map as bubble size.

Values can be plotted in absolute value, as a % of total dataset, as a % of total dataset after filters, or as a % of the result row. The last two options only make sense if you plot a result row.   

Resampling data means aggregating time series by a new time period.
