By default the app consider more "better", and therefore plots positive variances in green and negative variances in red. Positive variances of discounts and of COGS will be plotted red. 

If you are analyzing cost rather than revenue data you need to modify the default behavior. Simply set the VarianceğŸš¦widget to ğŸŸ¢-ğŸ”´+ (less is good, more is bad) instead of the default ğŸ”´-ğŸŸ¢+ (less is bad, more is good).

The charts will show positive variances in red and the metric will automatically be shown as "Costs" instead of "Sales"

If the dataset does not contain quantity information variance will be computed as an aggregate.
